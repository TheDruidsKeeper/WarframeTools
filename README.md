# WarframeTools
Utility to parse json data intercepted from communications between the official Warframe android app (iOS untested - let me know if it works too) and their API.

## Setup
Set up an [https proxy](https://blog.heckel.xyz/2013/07/01/how-to-use-mitmproxy-to-read-and-modify-https-traffic-of-your-phone/), and save the inventory json to the path you set in the app config. Run the app, and paste the results into a spreadsheet.
